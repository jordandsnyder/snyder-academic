My research interests include clinical-community psychology, global mental health, serious mental illness, interventions for mental health in low and middle-income countries, and mental health and social processes related to conflict. Ultimately, through my research and applied work, I seek to empower communities and organizations to answer the questions that are important to them so that they can effectively change their communities.
