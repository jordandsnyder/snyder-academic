abstract: Family members who witnessed the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi arguably shape their children’s narratives of the events and subsequent formation of outgroup prejudice. An understanding of whether vestiges of the genocide are transmitted to future generations informs ongoing peacebuilding efforts. We, therefore, examined the relationship between child and guardian attitudes toward one’s outgroup among households of survivors or perpetrators and investigated whether this relationship was potentially affected by social interactions with members of outgroups outside the family. Rather than being passively shaped by their guardians’ experiences, our results suggested that a new generation of viewpoints was being formed by relationships within and outside the family.
